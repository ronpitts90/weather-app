# weather-app

my weather app : file:///Users/ronaldpitts/Desktop/bootcamp_files/my-hw-folder/weather-app/index.html

This app will show current and future weather within a 5 day range including date, temperature, windspeed and humidity.

FIRST I create an html file titled index and set it up
THEN I create the necessary divs, conatiners, ids, and classes I will be using on the page and linking to my CSS and JS files
THEN I create the styling sheet and connect it using thee style tag and established classes and ids
AFTER THAT I start on my JS script file 
AND create a function for the search button click event and create a variables for the city input 
NEXT I create if else statements for errors in case a valid city is not entered 
THEN I make an ajax call to begin grabbing the information from the my weather API
THEN within the ajax call I paste in my API key for the ajax call 
NEXT I create a function to display the data in the browser in accordance to the recent call
THEN I create the lines of code for how I want the information to be displayed
